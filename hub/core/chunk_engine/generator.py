    """
    Generator function that chunks bytes.

    Chunking is the process of taking the input `content_bytes` & breaking it up into smaller chunks,
    the sizes of which are <= `chunk_size`.

    Example 1:
        content_bytes = b"101010101010"
        chunk_size = 4
        output_chunks = [b"1010", b"1010", b"1010"]

        This is considered a "perfect fit" because all bytes fit perfectly into 3 chunks.


    Example 2:
        content_bytes = b"10101010111122"
        chunk_size = 4
        output_chunks = [b"1010", b"1010", b"1111", b"22"]

        As you can see, the last chunk in `output_chunks` only has 2 bytes (chunk_size=4), which means
        this is not a perfect fit, but rather it has a partial chunk at the end.


    Args:
        content_bytes(bytes): Bytes object with the data to be chunked.
        previous_num_bytes(int): The number of bytes in the previous chunk. This is helpful for filling the previous chunk before starting a new one.
        chunk_size(int): Each individual chunk will be assigned this many bytes maximum.

    Yields:
        chunk(bytes): Chunk of the `content_bytes`. Each chunk is of length (0, `chunk_size`].
        relative_chunk_index(int): Relative index to the previous chunk. Relative index encodings:
            0: Add to previous chunk.
            > 0: Add to a new empty chunk that is `relative_chunk_index` chunks after the previous chunk. For example, if `relative_chunk_index` = 5, then 4 new empty chunks have already been created by this generator, & this is the 5th one.

    Raises:
        ChunkGeneratorError: If leftover bytes are negative or the previous chunk was invalid.
